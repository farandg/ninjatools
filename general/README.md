# CLEANUP_FILE.SH

## Delete Lines Starting with Pattern Script

This script deletes all lines in a file that start with a given pattern. It takes two arguments: the file name and the pattern.

### Prerequisites

- Bash
- sed

### Usage

First, make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
```

Then, run the script with the required arguments:

```bash
./script_name.sh file_name pattern
```
Replace script_name.sh with the name of the script file, file_name with the path to the file you want to process, and pattern with the pattern you want to match at the beginning of lines to be deleted.
