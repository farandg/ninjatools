# CI PIPELINE SCRIPTS

## TERRAFORM

Welcome to my Terraform validation scripts.

The first script runs terraform plan in all directories containing *.tf files, allowing you to quickly assess the impact of your infrastructure changes. The second script runs terraform validate in the same directories, giving you the confidence that your code is following the right standards and guidelines.

These scripts are easy to use and customizable to fit your needs. And since they're open-source and freely available for anyone to use and modify, you can contribute back to the community and help make Terraform a better tool for everyone.

So if you're looking for a quick and easy way to validate and plan your Terraform code, look no further. Give these scripts a try and see how they can help you level up your infrastructure as code game!
