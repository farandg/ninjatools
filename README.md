# NINJATOOLS

Welcome to Ninjatools - my personal collection of custom-made tools and scripts for savvy DevOps engineers wanting to save themsemves some time!

I have developped these tools on the job, either to help me speed up my workflow, or simply so as not to type the same command a thousand times.
All of my tools are open-source and freely available for anyone to use and modify, so you can contribute back to the community and share the ninja love.

Whether you're a seasoned DevOps veteran or just starting out, Ninjatools has something for everyone.

But wait, there's more! If you act **now**, I'll throw in a bonus tool that will make your morning coffee, sharpen your katana, and even do your laundry! (Disclaimer: I cannot actually guarantee any of those things, but my tools are pretty awesome nonetheless.)
