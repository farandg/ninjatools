# NINJATOOLS

Welcome to Ninjatools - my personal collection of custom-made tools and scripts.

As a DevOps engineer, I have developped these tools on the job to help speed up my workflow.  
So they might not make your morning coffee or sharpen your katana, but they might save you a bit of time.  
Feel free to use, modify, and make them your own. But please do share cool improvements if you make any.
