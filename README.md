# NINJATOOLS

Welcome to Ninjatools - my personal collection of custom-made tools and scripts for savvy DevOps engineers who want to up their game and save themsemves some time!

As a DevOps engineer, I know how frustrating it can be to endlessly search for the right tool or script to solve a problem. That's why I created Ninjatools - to offer battle-tested and proven tools that make your life easier and your work more efficient.

All of my tools are open-source and freely available for anyone to use and modify, so you can contribute back to the community and share the ninja love.

Whether you're a seasoned DevOps veteran or just starting out, Ninjatools has something for everyone. So why wait? Join the ninja revolution and start automating like a boss today!

But wait, there's more! If you act now, I'll throw in a bonus tool that will make your morning coffee, sharpen your katana, and even do your laundry! (Disclaimer: I cannot actually guarantee any of those things, but my tools are pretty awesome nonetheless.)
